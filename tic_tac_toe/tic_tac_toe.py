# You will write a tic tac toc player and play game with this computer player.
# You will use MiniMaxSearch with depth limited strategy. For simplicity, Alpha-Beta Pruning
# is not considered.
# Let's make some assumptions.
# 1. The computer player(1) use circle(1) and you(-1) use cross(-1).
# 2. The computer player is MAX user and you are MIN user.
# 3. The miniMaxSearch depth is 3, so that the computer predict one step further. It first
# predicts what you will do if it makes a move and choose a move that maximize its gain.
# 4. You play first
